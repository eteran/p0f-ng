This directory contains several helper tools mentioned in the main README:

  p0f-sendsyn.cpp   - a tool for gathering new SYN+ACK signatures

  p0f-sendsyn6.cpp  - the same, for IPv6 destinations

  p0f-client.cpp    - simple API client tool for p0f -s mode

Note that IPv6 addresses need to be passed to the utilities in a fully-expanded
form (i.e., no ::).
